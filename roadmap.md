# Roadmap

<b>LavaDAO Treasury-</b><i> HeliumDenver as been awarded a $500 event grant to help fund our efforts!</i><br>Create a community governance SPL token called Lava, <i>LVA</i>, which will be consist of 10,000 Kimberlites, <i>KBL</i>, to be burned for voting. 
<br><br>
<b>Voting System-</b> Create a voting platform that allows users to participate in community governance.
<br><br>
<b>HOAP Dispenser-</b> Create SFT creator platform for other event spaces. Working in collaboration with Solanasoap, we intend to streamline the process for other Helium event's to create attendance tokens specifically for the Helium network, as well as provide an in depth walk through for deploying the Solanasoap portal locally including Shadowdrive / Bndlr storage and keypair generation and storage.
<br><br>
<b>Point-Of-Sale System-</b> Create a Point-of-Sale system to provide to storefronts around HeliumDenver events that allows users to pay for a product or service using SPL tokens, allowing the vendor to enter a total, generate a QR code, allowing the customer to complete the payment, and which converts those payments to USDC for the vendor. 
<br><br>
<b>IoT Crypto Arcade-</b> Create an integration method for arcade cabinets that facilitates SPL settlements completed over IoT. Companies like Heliport have taken steps towards these integrations, and we've begun communications with them in order to see how we can work together.  
<br><br>
<b>Hackathon-</b> Create a bounty platform that allows sponsors to lobby awards competed for by developers within the ecosystem.
<br><br>
<b>More to come...</b>
