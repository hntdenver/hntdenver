# HeliumIIDAO

The first official <a href="https://magiceden.io/item-details/7mhwVJqY3uwk7b9ks7D5SZPhFpXEMfkbCE58dM125kTQ" target="_blank">HNTDenver NFT</a> has been minted!<br><br> Listed, but for no reason, it's NFS.
Currently, the poor thing doesn't provide any actual utility, but it will soon! We're working with <a href="https://solanasoap.lol/" target="_blank">Solanasoap</a> to create SFTs for attendees to our events that are free-to-mint, which is a great onboarding tool for newcomers. If you've ever spent $15 in gas fees to claim a 'free' collectible on ETH, you know what makes this so exciting.<br><br>
## Hoap Dispenser
We will be creating a front end user interface that allows hosts of other Helium events around the globe to create SFTs for their guests using a Hoap Dispenser, which is simply a repackaging of the functionality of the official Solana Soap webpage. We just wanted to give it a little Helium flare, and the pun was too good to resist. ðŸŽˆ
