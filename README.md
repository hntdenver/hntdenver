# HNTDenverDAO

<a href="https://heliumdenver.com" target="_blank">HNTDenver</a> is building a Helium community in Denver, similar to ETHDenver, which will be managed by LavaDAO, as ETHDenver is by SporkDAO. We take direct inspiration from their community owned and community governed event ecosystem, and are excited to work alongside them in circumstances which allow us to do so.<br><br>

The fully realized vision is a recurring Helium ecosystem hackathon, usecase hardware and solutions expo, pop-up 5G deployment, LoRa sensor demo / vendors, hotspot owners, radio vendors, and more. HNTDenver will be a way for solutions providers to advertise to businesses, builders to get together and grow the network, hotspot owners to oggle some hardware, and create an overall good time on a regular basis. The framework will be open sourced and we hope it serves as a springboard to Helium communities elsewhere.<br><br>

## From a High Level

HNTDenver will become an ecosystem epicenter where sponsors offer bounties based on the needs of the ecosystem, and builders can compete for these prizes. LoRa and 5G radios will be deployed on site allowing visitors to use the Helium network. Usecases can market their projects, hotspot owners can discuss deployment strategies, businesses can seek built-to-suit solutions, builders can collaborate and develop within the ecosystem. Live music, exclusive after parties, and more!<br><br>
